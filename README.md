# TV Picker
Find the code for different iterations of my TV picker function. The function takes in a name of a TV show and tells you a random episode of it to watch! As someone who rewatches the same TV shows and movies, sometimes I need a random episode to watch. So, I wrote this function to help me decide. 

January 18 2023: As of now, all iterations do not weight each episode equally. Each season is weighted equally, and episodes *within the same season* are equally weighted.
